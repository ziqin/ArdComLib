These files come from [vczh-libraries/Vlpp](https://github.com/vczh-libraries/Vlpp) Project and was modified so as to be used by Arduino.

ArdComLib uses Vlpp as a replacement of C++11 STL `std::function`. For example, we can use `vl::Func<unsigned(int)>` to replace `std::function<unsigned(int)>`.

Note: these ported codes haven't been adequately tested.
